# 📚 Document Management System (PHP + Laravel + XAMPP + MySQL)

A **secure, scalable, enterprise-ready document management system** built with **Laravel** running on **XAMPP (Apache + MySQL)**. It supports advanced search (keyword + AI semantic search), version control, secure file handling, preview system, analytics, and extensible AI-powered document intelligence.

The system ships as **two separate web applications** sharing a single Laravel backend and database:

| App | URL Prefix | Audience |
|---|---|---|
| **Admin Panel** | `/admin` | Admins and Editors — full document and user management |
| **Client Web App** | `/` | All authenticated users — browse, search, preview, download |

All files are stored locally on the server machine (no cloud dependency).

---

# ⚙️ Prerequisites

| Requirement | Version |
|---|---|
| PHP | 10+ / 11+ |
| MySQL | 8.0+ |
| XAMPP | 8.x (Apache + MySQL) |
| Composer | 2.x |
| Node.js / npm | 18+ (for Tailwind CSS build) |
| Redis | 7+ (for queues and caching) |
| PHP Extensions | `zip`, `pdo_mysql`, `fileinfo`, `mbstring`, `openssl`, `gd` or `imagick` |
| LibreOffice | Optional — required only for DOCX → PDF full-fidelity preview |

---

# 🚀 Installation

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone <repo-url>
cd docmanager

# 2. Install PHP dependencies
composer install

# 3. Install frontend dependencies
npm install && npm run build

# 4. Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate

# 5. Edit .env — set DB credentials, queue driver, cache driver, mail settings

# 6. Run database migrations
php artisan migrate --seed

# 7. Start the queue worker
php artisan queue:work --queue=default

# 8. Serve via XAMPP or built-in server
php artisan serve
```

---

# 🎨 Frontend Stack

Both the **Admin Panel** and **Client Web App** are built with **Tailwind CSS + Alpine.js + Flowbite**, compiled and bundled locally — no CDN required, fully offline-capable.

| Library | Role |
|---|---|
| **Tailwind CSS** | Utility-first CSS — compiled to a single static file via `npm run build` |
| **Alpine.js** | Lightweight JS for interactivity (modals, dropdowns, upload progress, search filters) |
| **Flowbite** | Pre-built Tailwind components (tables, sidebars, stat cards, dashboards, modals) |

### Shared layout approach

* `resources/views/layouts/admin.blade.php` — Admin Panel shell (sidebar nav, topbar)
* `resources/views/layouts/app.blade.php` — Client Web App shell (header, category sidebar)
* All Blade views extend one of these two layouts
* XSS protection via Blade's `{{ }}` auto-escaping on all output

### Install frontend dependencies

```bash
npm install tailwindcss @tailwindcss/forms flowbite alpinejs
npm run build
```

All output is written to `public/build/` — served entirely from the local machine.

```
Root
├── Finance
│   ├── Invoices
│   └── Reports
├── Legal
│   └── Contracts
└── HR
    └── Policies
```

* Admins and Editors manage the category tree

# 🔎 Advanced Search System

The system uses a **multi-layer hybrid search engine**.

## 1. Metadata Search (Fast)

Search by: file name, title, description.

## 2. Full-Text Search (MySQL)

Full-text index on `resources(title, description, content)` — defined in schema.

## 3. File Content Search

Text extracted from PDF, DOCX, and TXT files and stored in `resources.content (LONGTEXT)`.

## 4. AI Semantic Search (Vector-Based)

### Architecture:

```
User Query
   ↓
Embedding Model (OpenAI / Local LLM)
   ↓
Vector Database (Qdrant / Chroma / Weaviate)
   ↓
Similarity Matching
   ↓
Ranked Results
```

### Features:

* Meaning-based search (not keyword-based)
* Finds similar documents
* Natural language queries

## 5. Hybrid Search Engine

```
Keyword Search (MySQL)
+ Full-text Search
+ Vector Search (AI)
+ Content Search
→ Ranking Engine
→ Final Results
```

---

## 🔍 Search Ranking System

Scoring model:

* Title match → +5
